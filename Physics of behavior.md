Keytake aways:
* Alex Mathis - how to generalize network (immediate Yeselth)
* center of masss stream line 
* Ugne and Ann for comparison 


Hi,
I am following up with some subjective points/reflections triggered by the Physical of behavior workshop:

[practical - short mid term consideration]
* build stronger network (Alex Mathis) - implication for Yeselth regarding the labeling of pupil video focused for the shock wheel
    - label few shock wheel videos (around 20) based on the WDIL pupil data
    - check if this is sufficient
    - if not build own network that could be combine
* we should start incorporate deeplabcut for anytype of tracking (from pose estimation (shock wheel video) and also simple center of mass (temp gradient)), rationale:
    - currently developping on infrastructure (by Seth) that is versitile to extract the raw data from the network
    - should be relatively easy to implement now that everyone is familiar with it
    - both flexible and enable potential cross application
 * VERY IMPORTANT point that has implication for our work: 
 	- approach using key points (dlc) == good more intuitive to understand what is the feature
 	- approach using texture (facemap) == identify components and motion energy the actual nature of the components is not easy/intuitive to ascertain

[conceptual/practical - mid/long term]
* good conceptual descrition of flow and genotype comparison- Ugne Klibaite
* should consider for future going one step forward with classifiers very amenable for Yeselth project with the shcokwheel

Very important go back to Stringer et al 2019 for face and behavior

* record brain and behavior hiding of internal state
* behavior not visible at the brain state

#### papers:
* face and multibehavior dimension distributed activity in the brain [Stringer et al 2019](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6437/eaav7893.editor-summary)
* pupil fluctuation [Reimer et al 20016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13289)
* behavioral mapping [Berman](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2014.0672)

collective behavior multiple animals // animal in groups
challenges while tracking those multilevel dat
* what to measure? (power of prior knowledge about the system)
* context
* memory/timescale
* causality
* what to ask

* important issue of context emerging principles that are generalizable

Behavioral motif // postural syntax // hierarchical charcterization need too look and gather many data to see emerging pattern and sequences


### Ugne Klibaite

Very relevant approach to Syngap
Good insight into comparison etc

### William Bialek

behavior is low dimensional and thus the neural activity that generates behavior shoudl also be low dimensional (100 dimension is low)
dimensionality can change
importance of sampling long time scale

idea of stationnary and the idea of time scale and change of state across this time scale and impact on dimensionality (continum vs)

### Alex Mathis
[lab](https://github.com/alexemg) co developper of dlc
across lab and longer recordings
generalization across 
strategy to generalization:
* scale up the datasets
* better dataset

retraining and creating more robust network 
[dlc-modelzoo](http://www.mousemotorlab.org/dlc-modelzoo)

texture of the image vs key points (low dimension)
meaning of the component when do key points

great outlook and description of the workflow
interesting how the pose animals are marked
good type of comparison between type of animals with the example of sniffing
idea of labeling function

interesting what is the system individual and group is tryping to optimize really important questions
